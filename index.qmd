## Predictive approaches to HTE

::: {.panel-tabset}


### Treatment effect modeling

$$
E\{y|x_1,\dots,x_p,T\} = f(x_1,\dots,x_p, T)
$$


For example,

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(y = 1|x_1,\dots,x_p,T) = &f\big(\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\dots+\beta_px_p+ \\
& (\gamma_0+\gamma_1x_1+\dots\gamma_px_p)\times T\big)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$f(u) = \frac{e^u}{1 + e^u}$$

### Risk-based

$$
E\{y|x_1,\dots,x_p,T\} = f(lp(x_1,\dots,x_p), T)
$$
For example,
$$lp(x_1,\dots,x_p) = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\dots+\beta_px_p$$
and $$P(y = 1|x_1,\dots,x_p,T=0) = f(lp) = \frac{e^{lp}}{1 + e^{lp}}$$

### OTR

$$
T_{\text{optimal}} = \text{argmax}_TE\Big\{ E\{ y\mid x_1,\dots,x_p,T(x_1,\dots,x_p) \} \Big\}
$$

## Problem definition


> Compare the effect of thiazides or thiazide-like diuretics (THZ) to the effect
> of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with established
> hypertension with respect to 12 outcomes

:::{style="font-size: 70%;"}

\

**Main outcomes**: acute myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization with heart
failure, stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

\

**Safety outcomes**: acute renal failure,
kidney disease, cough, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, gastrointestinal bleeding,
hyponatremia, hypotension, angioedema

## Databases

:::{style="font-size: 70%;"}

- **IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database (CCAE)**:  includes health insurance
claims across the continuum of care (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, outpatient
pharmacy, carve-out behavioral healthcare) as well as enrollment data from large
employers and health plans across the United States who provide private
healthcare coverage for more than 157 million employees, their spouses, and
dependents.

\

- **IBM® MarketScan® Multi-State Medicaid Database (MDCD)**: reflects the
healthcare service use of individuals covered by Medicaid programs in numerous
geographically dispersed states.

\

- **IBM® MarketScan® Medicare Supplemental Database (MDCR)**: represents the 
health services of approximately 10 million retirees in the United States with
Medicare supplemental coverage through employer-sponsored plans.

## Study populations

## Prediction step

- Separate acute MI risk prediction models fitted within each database
- Risk strata defined: below 1%, between 1% and 1.5%, above 1.5%

## Interpretation

- Overall benefits with THZ for the prevention of acute MI were mainly driven by
high-risk patients.
- Negligible absolute benefits with THZ in low-risk patients.
- Not negligible hypokalemia and hyponatremia risk increase with THZ across all
risk groups.
- Cough risk increase with ACE inhibitors.
