## Predictive approaches to HTE

::: {.panel-tabset}


### Treatment effect modeling

$$
E\{y|x_1,\dots,x_p,T\} = f(x_1,\dots,x_p, T)
$$


For example,

$$
\begin{aligned}
P(y = 1|x_1,\dots,x_p,T) = &f\big(\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\dots+\beta_px_p+ \\
& (\gamma_0+\gamma_1x_1+\dots\gamma_px_p)\times T\big)
\end{aligned}
$$

$$f(u) = \frac{e^u}{1 + e^u}$$

### Risk-based

$$
E\{y|x_1,\dots,x_p,T\} = f(lp(x_1,\dots,x_p), T)
$$
For example,
$$lp(x_1,\dots,x_p) = \beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\dots+\beta_px_p$$
and $$P(y = 1|x_1,\dots,x_p,T=0) = f(lp) = \frac{e^{lp}}{1 + e^{lp}}$$

### OTR

$$
T_{\text{optimal}} = \text{argmax}_TE\Big\{ E\{ y\mid x_1,\dots,x_p,T(x_1,\dots,x_p) \} \Big\}
$$

## Problem definition


> Compare the effect of thiazides or thiazide-like diuretics (THZ) to the effect
> of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients with established
> hypertension with respect to 12 outcomes

:::{style="font-size: 70%;"}

\

**Main outcomes**: acute myocardial infarction (MI), hospitalization with heart
failure, stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic)

\

**Safety outcomes**: acute renal failure,
kidney disease, cough, hyperkalemia, hypokalemia, gastrointestinal bleeding,
hyponatremia, hypotension, angioedema

## Databases

:::{style="font-size: 70%;"}

- **IBM® MarketScan® Commercial Database (CCAE)**:  includes health insurance
claims across the continuum of care (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, outpatient
pharmacy, carve-out behavioral healthcare) as well as enrollment data from large
employers and health plans across the United States who provide private
healthcare coverage for more than 157 million employees, their spouses, and
dependents.

\

- **IBM® MarketScan® Multi-State Medicaid Database (MDCD)**: reflects the
healthcare service use of individuals covered by Medicaid programs in numerous
geographically dispersed states.

\

- **IBM® MarketScan® Medicare Supplemental Database (MDCR)**: represents the 
health services of approximately 10 million retirees in the United States with
Medicare supplemental coverage through employer-sponsored plans.

## Interpretation

\

- Overall benefits with THZ for the prevention of acute MI were mainly driven by
high-risk patients.
- Negligible absolute benefits with THZ in low-risk patients.
- Not negligible hypokalemia and hyponatremia risk increase with THZ across all
risk groups.
- Cough risk increase with ACE inhibitors.


## Simulation study

\

> **Aim**: Compare different risk-based models for the prediction of
> individualized treatment effects.

\

We observe RCT data $(Z, X, Y)$, where for each patient $Z_i= 0, 1$ is the
treatment status, $Y_i = 0, 1$ is the observed outcome and $X_i$ is a set of
measured covariates. 

## Simulation study

\

Let $\{Y_i(z), z=0, 1\}$ denote the unobservable potential
outcomes.

\

We observe $Y_i = Z_iY_i(1) + (1 - Z_i)Y_i(0)$.

\

We are interested in
predicting the conditional average treatment effect (CATE), 
$$\tau(x) = E\{Y(0) - Y(1)|X=x\}$$ 


## Simulation study

$$
\newcommand{\indep}{\perp \!\!\! \perp}
\newcommand\given[1][]{\:#1\vert\:}
$$



Assuming that $\big(Y(0), Y(1)\big)\indep Z|X$, as we are in the RCT setting, we
can predict CATE from
\begin{align*}
\tau(x) &= E\{Y(0)\given X=x\}-E\{Y(1)\given X=x\}\\
&=E\{Y\given X=x, Z=0\}-E\{Y\given X=x, Z=1\}
\end{align*}

## Simulation study - Scenarios

\

For each patient we generated 8 baseline
covariates $x_1,\dots,x_4\sim N(0, 1)$ and $x_5,\dots,x_8\sim
B(1,0.2)$.

\

Outcomes in the control arm were generated using

$$P(Y(0)=1\given X=x) = \text{expit}(lp_0) = e^{lp_0}/(1+e^{lp_0})$$

with $lp_0=lp_0(x)=x^t\beta$.

## Simulation study - Scenarios

\

Outcomes in the treatment arm were first generated using 3 simple scenarios for
constant relative treatment effect:


- absent (OR = 1)
- moderate (OR = 0.8)
- strong (OR = 0.5)

## Simulation study - Scenarios

\

We introduced linear, quadratic and non-monotonic deviations

$$lp_1 = \gamma_2(lp_0-c)^2 +
\gamma_1(lp_0-c) + \gamma_0, $$ where $lp_1$ is the true linear predictor in the
treatment arm, so that $P(Y(1)=1\given X=x) = \text{expit}(lp_1)$


## Simulation study - Scenarios

\

Introduced treatment-related harms (absent, moderate, strong, positive) such that

$$
P(Y(1)=1|X=x) = \text{expit}(lp_1) + \text{harm}
$$

\

Combining all the settings we ended up with a total of 648 simulation scenarios:

:::{style="font-size: 53%;"}

$$
3 \text{ base scenarios }\times 3 \text{ baseline risk settings } \times 3 \text{ sample size settings} \times 6 \text{ true interaction settings} \times 4 \text{ harm settings }
$$

## Simulation study - Application

\

*GUSTO-I trial*

- 30,510 patients with acute myocardial infarction
- 10,348 patients randomized to tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) treatment
- 20,162 patients randomized to streptokinase
- outcome of interest: 30-day mortality (total of 2,128 events)


## Simulation study - Methods

\

*Constant relative treatment effect*

$$P(Y=1 | X=x, Z=z;\hat{\beta}) = \text{expit}(\hat{lp}_0 + \delta_1z)$$

\

absolute benefit is predicted from 
$$\tau(x;\hat{\beta}) = \text{expit}(\hat{lp}_0)-\text{expit}(\hat{lp}_0+\delta_1)$$


## Simulation study - Methods

\

*Linear interaction*

$$P(Y=1|X=x,Z=z;\hat{\beta})=\text{expit}(\delta_0+\delta_1z+\delta_2\hat{lp}_0+\delta_3z\hat{lp}_0)$$
\

Absolute benefit predicted from
$$\tau(x;\hat{\beta}) = \text{expit}(\delta_0+\delta_2\hat{lp}_0)-\text{expit}\Big((\delta_0+\delta_1)+(\delta_2+\delta_3)\hat{lp}_0\Big)$$


## Simulation study - Methods

\

*Restricted cubic splines*
to relax the linearity assumption on the effect of the linear predictor. We
considered splines with 3 (RCS-3), 4 (RCS-4) and 5 (RCS-5) knots

\

*Adaptive approach* using AIC

## Simulation study - Conclusions

\

:::{style="font-size: 81%;"}

- The linear interaction approach is a viable option with moderate sample sizes
and / or  moderately performing risk prediction models
- RCS-3 is preferable with abundant sample size
- Increasing the complexity of the RCS models by increasing the number of knots
does not improve benefit prediction
- Using AIC for model selection is attractive with larger sample size
