## Predictive approaches to HTE

::: {.panel-tabset}


### Treatment effect modeling

$$
E\{Y|X=x, Z=z\} = f(x,z)
$$


For example,

$$
P(Y = 1|x,z) = f(x^t\beta+\gamma xz)
$$

$$f(u) = \frac{e^u}{1 + e^u}$$

### Risk modeling

$$
E\{Y|X=x, Z=z\} = f(lp(x), z) 
$$
For example,

$$
P(Y=1|X=x,Z=z) = f(lp + \gamma z + s(lp)z)
$$

## Framework - Interpretation

\

- Overall benefits with THZ for the prevention of acute MI were mainly driven by
high-risk patients.
- Negligible absolute benefits with THZ in low-risk patients.
- Not negligible hypokalemia and hyponatremia risk increase with THZ across all
risk groups.
- Cough risk increase with ACE inhibitors.


## Framework - Limitations

\

- Separate database-specific prediction models
- Did not account for competing risks
- Did not correct for multiplicity
- Only used databases readily available to us

## Simulation study

\

> **Aim**: Compare different risk-based regression modeling approaches 
> for the prediction of individualized treatment effects in RCT setting

\

We observe RCT data $(Z, X, Y)$, where for each patient $Z_i= 0, 1$ is the
treatment status, $Y_i = 0, 1$ is the observed outcome and $X_i$ is a set of
measured covariates. 

## Simulation study

\

Let $\{Y_i(z), z=0, 1\}$ denote the unobservable potential
outcomes.

\

We observe $Y_i = Z_iY_i(1) + (1 - Z_i)Y_i(0)$.

\

We are interested in
predicting the conditional average treatment effect (CATE), 
$$\tau(x) = E\{Y(0) - Y(1)|X=x\}$$ 


## Simulation study

$$
\newcommand{\indep}{\perp \!\!\! \perp}
\newcommand\given[1][]{\:#1\vert\:}
$$



Assuming that $\big(Y(0), Y(1)\big)\indep Z|X$, as we are in the RCT setting, we
can predict CATE from
\begin{align*}
\tau(x) &= E\{Y(0)\given X=x\}-E\{Y(1)\given X=x\}\\
&=E\{Y\given X=x, Z=0\}-E\{Y\given X=x, Z=1\}
\end{align*}


## Simulation study - Methods

\

*Constant relative treatment effect*

$$P(Y=1 | X=x, Z=z;\hat{\beta}) = \text{expit}(\hat{lp}_0 + \delta_1z)$$

\

absolute benefit is predicted from 
$$\tau(x;\hat{\beta}) = \text{expit}(\hat{lp}_0)-\text{expit}(\hat{lp}_0+\delta_1)$$


## Simulation study - Methods

\

*Linear interaction*

$$P(Y=1|X=x,Z=z;\hat{\beta})=\text{expit}(\delta_0+\delta_1z+\delta_2\hat{lp}_0+\delta_3z\hat{lp}_0)$$
\

Absolute benefit predicted from
$$\tau(x;\hat{\beta}) = \text{expit}(\delta_0+\delta_2\hat{lp}_0)-\text{expit}\Big((\delta_0+\delta_1)+(\delta_2+\delta_3)\hat{lp}_0\Big)$$


## Simulation study - Methods

\

*Restricted cubic splines*
to relax the linearity assumption on the effect of the linear predictor. We
considered splines with 3 (RCS-3), 4 (RCS-4) and 5 (RCS-5) knots

\

*Adaptive approach* using AIC


## Simulation study - Scenarios

\

For each patient we generated 8 baseline
covariates $x_1,\dots,x_4\sim N(0, 1)$ and $x_5,\dots,x_8\sim
B(1,0.2)$.

\

Outcomes in the control arm were generated using

$$P(Y(0)=1\given X=x) = \text{expit}(lp_0) = e^{lp_0}/(1+e^{lp_0})$$

with $lp_0=lp_0(x)=x^t\beta$.

## Simulation study - Scenarios

\

Outcomes in the treatment arm were first generated using 3 simple scenarios for
constant relative treatment effect:


- absent (OR = 1)
- moderate (OR = 0.8)
- strong (OR = 0.5)

## Simulation study - Scenarios

\

We introduced linear, quadratic and non-monotonic deviations

$$lp_1 = \gamma_2(lp_0-c)^2 +
\gamma_1(lp_0-c) + \gamma_0, $$ where $lp_1$ is the true linear predictor in the
treatment arm, so that $P(Y(1)=1\given X=x) = \text{expit}(lp_1)$


## Simulation study - Scenarios

\

Introduced treatment-related harms (absent, moderate, strong, negative) such that

$$
P(Y(1)=1|X=x) = \text{expit}(lp_1) + \text{harm}
$$

\

Combining all the settings we ended up with a total of 648 simulation scenarios:

:::{style="font-size: 53%;"}

$$
3 \text{ base scenarios }\times 3 \text{ baseline risk settings } \times 3 \text{ sample size settings} \times 6 \text{ true interaction settings} \times 4 \text{ harm settings }
$$

## Simulation study - Conclusions

\

:::{style="font-size: 81%;"}

- The linear interaction approach is a viable option with moderate sample sizes
and / or  moderately performing risk prediction models
- RCS-3 is preferable with abundant sample size
- Increasing the complexity of the RCS models by increasing the number of knots
does not improve benefit prediction
- Using AIC for model selection is attractive with larger sample size

:::


## Simulation study - Limitations

\

- True benefit function of baseline risk
- Statistically independent covariates
- Linear effects of continuous covariates
- No covariate interactions
